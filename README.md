<==============Build Notes===================>
<============================================>

<===This design is still is a work in progress===>
<===If you choose to print as is please expect to waste filament/resin===>

->**MOTOR SHAFT IN THIS DESIGN IS 10MM**

->If your motor has a different shaft diamter(it probably does) please modify .f3d accordingly before printing rotor

->Designed for A nema 23 with a 10x20mm shaft 

->All M5 Screws are socket head type.

->Designed with printing the rotor and rollers on Saturn SLA resin printer but a well tuned fdm printer should do it, though post processing is likely going to be needed either way.

->When tightening the Pump Housing half shells togther be mindfull not to pinch the tubing especially at the inlet/outlet ports
	-> When tightening half shells togther go slowly and tighten down each screw a little at a time before moving to the next screw so the top shells move down over the tubing evenly.

->The 625 bearings should slide into the rollers without force, they should be snug but not forced, they will break if they are forced into a hole that is too small for them and forced to rotate
	-> 2/3rds of my bearings are now crunchy :>

->It is worth smoothing down any sharp edges left over from the printing process anywhere where the silicone tube comes into contact with the printed parts. 

->May be worth using super glue to permentaly set the nuts on the bottom halfshell when I pulled them into the cover they deformed the pla and spun in place. 

-> the M5 Screws securing the halfshells togther should be able to be insert all the way to the nut without interfacing with the plastic, if they do drill or file to the correct size before securing hose in place.
