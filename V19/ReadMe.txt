<============Basic Instructions==============>
<============================================>

->Set M5 nuts into bottom half shell use screw to pull them into the plastic, use a longer screw than need so if nuts deform plastic and spin in place you can push them out. 

->Set M5 Nuts into rotor same process as bottom halfshell. 

->Assemble rotor with rollers 
Insert 625 bearings into rollers, they should be able to be insert with very little effort and be able to be removed with out forcing them. 
Don't try to force bearings to fit they may go but they'll get crunchy quickly, like 2/3rds of my bearings are now :<

-> Insert rollers with bearings into the rotor and secure with m5x30 and nut, they don't need to be very tight just enough so they won't back out, blue locktight may help.

-> Attach bottom halfshell to stepper with M5x10 I had to use washers between motor and shell and a set of m5 nuts between top of the screw and the motor to ensure screws do not protrude to far, they should end up flush.

-> Insert assembled rotor assembly onto the motor shaft take care to get the placement correct the set screw hole should be just about inline with the tool access hole(the nose of the face).

-> Insert tubing, helps to turn the rotor, get the tube down about halfway between body and rollers. 

-> Carefully tighten down the top halfshell making sure not to pinch the tubing, the housing don't need to be torqued down real tight get them flush and once you test run the motor back off enough the motor runs smoothly.
