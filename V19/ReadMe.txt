<==============Build Notes===================>
<============================================>

<===This design is still is a work in progress===>
<===If you choose to print as is please expect to waste filament/resin===>

->**MOTOR SHAFT IN THIS DESIGN IS 10MM**

->If your motor has a different shaft diamter(it probably does) please modify .f3d accordingly before printing rotor

->If annoying stepper motor noises are annoying to you too, I would advise not cheaping out on the stepper driver. 

->Designed for A nema 23 with a 10x20mm shaft 

->All M5 Screws are socket head type.

->Designed with printing the rotor and rollers on Saturn SLA resin printer but a well tuned fdm printer should do it, though post processing is likely going to be needed either way.

->When tightening the Pump Housing half shells togther be mindfull not to pinch the tubing especially at the inlet/outlet ports
	-> When tightening half shells togther go slowly and tighten down each screw a little at a time before moving to the next screw so the top shells move down over the tubing evenly.

->The 625 bearings should slide into the rollers without force, they should be snug but not forced, they will break if they are forced into a hole that is too small for them and forced to rotate
	-> 2/3rds of my bearings are now crunchy :>

->It is worth smoothing down any sharp edges left over from the printing process anywhere where the silicone tube comes into contact with the printed parts. 

->I will release the STLs seperatly from the .f3d when I have a tested working version I can be confident won't waste anyones time or plastic.
